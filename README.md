# CSE143Final
Poker Chips Simulator is a web app that simulates the betting of poker chips. It is best used with friends in a real life setting with a deck of cards. The web app is NOT the full implementation of poker; it only simulates the chips.

#Website:
To access our final project, Poker Chips Simulator, please go to http://34.221.107.58:3000/. You must have an internet connection and JavaScript must be enabled.

#Features:
You may choose to host or to join a poker table on the menu screen. If you choose to host a table, you will be prompted to input game settings. Some defaults are set for you, but you are free to change them. Upon hitting the “CREATE” button you will be sent to a waiting screen that will have a join code to share with your friends. This join code may be entered under the “JOIN TABLE” page seen on the menu screen.
Upon hitting the “START GAME” button on the waiting screen you will be sent to your game table. This is where you will see the numerical value of your chips, your friends’ chips, and the pot. You are now ready to play poker.

#Important Notes:
-Usernames must be at least one character long.
-The valid Number of Players for a table is constrained to 3, 4, and 5. 
-The Starting Amount and Big Blind must be positive integers. 
-The Big Blind’s name for the round is Gold while the Small Blind’s name is Blue.
-Some large tablets will cause the table to improperly display. Please tilt your device horizontally or use a different device for the best experience. It will be easy to tell if the table is displayed incorrectly.
